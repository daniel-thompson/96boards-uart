Control utility for the 96board Console adapter

This program will control the power button and reset button signals when using a
96Boards USB console adaptor.

This program requires read/write access to the raw USB device in /dev/bus/usb/.
For convenience, a udev rule can be used to make the device group writable when
it is enumerated. Copy the file udev-rules/71-ftdi_sio.rules into
/etc/udev/rules.d

Prerequisites: cmake libftdi1-2 and libusb-1.0

Building:
$ apt-get install libftdi1-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake
$ cmake .
$ make
$ make install
